# Fundamentals of Data Analysis


Repository for Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module Winter 2023

## Contents of the Repository

This repository contains coursework created and maintained as part of the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis, undertaken as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics in ATU, Galway.

The repository contains three Jupyter notebooks

- mynotebook.ipynb (contains notes and code written by me throughout the module, for personal use)
- tasks.ipynb (contains my answers to assessment tasks set out by the module lecturer, accounts for 50% of the module assessment)
- project.ipynb (contains my code and notes for the project assessment set out by the module lecturer, accounts for 50% of the module assessment)

Other content in the repository is a .gitignore file which specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Running the Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks "tasks.ipynb" and "project.ipynb" can be ran in any code editor such as Visual Studio Code, or using the web application JupyterLab.

The notebooks contain all details in relation to both the Tasks and Project assessments for the module, including all references to research performed as part of the assessments.

To run the notebooks, the repository must first be cloned to the user's machine, which can be achieved by following the below instructions:

- First, navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the repository into using commands like:
    > cd: to change your working directory.

    > cd ../ to "go back" a level in your directory tree.

- Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
    > git clone https://github.com/rachel-king4/fundamentalsofdataanalysis.git

- Any changes made to the remote repository will not automatically sync with the local cloned copy. To update the local directory, navigate to the cloned directory and use this command:
    > git pull

Once the repository is cloned, the cloned directory can be opened and ran in a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
