# Fundamentals of Data Analysis


Repository for Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module Winter 2023

## Contents of the Repository

This repository contains coursework created and maintained as part of the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis, undertaken as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics in ATU, Galway.

The repository contains three Jupyter notebooks

- mynotebook.ipynb (contains notes and code written by me throughout the module)
- tasks.ipynb (contains my answers to assessment tasks set out by the module lecturer, accounts for 50% of the module assessment)
- project.ipynb (contains my code and notes for the project assessment set out by the module lecturer, accounts for 50% of the module assessment)

Other contents in the repository are a CSV file for the famous Penguins Dataset, which is required for the "Tasks" assessment section of this module; a number of images that are displayed in the "tasks.ipynb" notebook; and a .gitignore file which specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Running the Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks "tasks.ipynb" and "project.ipynb" can be ran in any code editor such as Visual Studio Code, or using the web application JupyterLab.

The notebooks contain all details in relation to both the Tasks and Project assessments for the module, including all references to research performed as part of the assessments.
